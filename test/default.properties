# The default agent properties. To use a different source of properties set
# the system property "propertiesUrl" to the URL of a properties file:
#
#   java -DpropertiesUrl=URL nuoagent.jar ...
#
# The default values for each property are shown in this file. All addresses
# can optionally include a port number using the syntax host:port.
#
# Note that all of these properties are optional, except for the domain
# password. A default value is assigned to this. Domain administrators should
# pick a new password to secure their domains.
#
# 2.0 History:
#
# 2.0.1
#   "metricsPurgeAge", "eventsPurgeAge" added
# 2.0.2
#   "automationTemplate" added
# 2.0.3
#   "automationTemplate": Once the admin db has been created during bootstrap,
#       use Auto Console UI to edit the admin db's template. The bootstrap
#       process will no longer upgrade the template as it did in 2.0.2
#   "peer" supports comma-separated list of peers
# 2.0.4
#   "agentPeerTimeout", "hostTags" added (optional)
#   "singleHostDbRestart" added, default TRUE
# 2.0.5
#    added support for policy "balancer=AffinityBalancer"
# 2.1
#   removed default "domainPassword"
#   added "removeSelfOnShutdown"
#   revised "heartbeatPeerTimeout"
#   Automation, managed databases:
#   * added "enableSystemDatabase"
#   * added "schEnforcerPeriodSec, schEnforcerInitDelaySec, runEnforcerOnEveryEvent"
#   * revised/deprecated "enableAutomation"
#   * removed "enableAutomationBootstrap", "enableHostStats", "eventsPurgeAge"
#
#   The "peer" property has been changed for brokers:
#   * A broker no longer supports a comma-separated list of peers
#   * A broker now supports its own address as peer attribute (peer to self)
#
#   added "RaftHeartbeatTimeout", "RaftMinElectionTimeout", "RaftMaxElectionTimeout"
#
# 2.1.1
#   added "RaftLogCompactionThreshold"

# The region for this host. The region of a host should not be changed after it
# has been set.

# via this property.  Ensure firewall rules allow access from other machines.

# Deprecated.
# A flag specifying whether this host has automation enabled. The behavior has
# changed in that automation no longer depends on the "nuodb_system" admin
# database, which is now optional. All agents and brokers in the domain should
# have the same value.

# is done using the 'peer' property.

# A flag specifying whether nuodb instances can only be started through this
# agent (as opposed to directly starting a nuodb process on the system). If this
# flag is true then a "connection key" is required of all nuodb instances. A
# connection key is only available if the process was started through a request
# on the agent. This is a good best-practice flag for locking down a system.
#requireConnectKey = false

# A flag specifying the SQL connection load balancer that this broker should
# use. The balancer determines how the broker chooses to which TE a SQL
# connection is routed. This property has no effect on an agent.
#
# Set this property to "RegionBalancer" to enable a policy where SQL clients
# are connected to TEs in this broker's region in a round-robin pattern. If
# no TEs are present in this broker's region then connections will be routed
# to TEs in any region in a round-robin pattern.
#
# Set this property to "AffinityBalancer" to enable a balancer that provides
# three simple options. First, if the connection request contains the property
# key "LBTag" then this balancer will look for an existing host with the same
# tag and matching values. Second, if there is a TE local to the host where
# the connection request was made then that TE is preferred. Finally, failing
# either test, simple round-robin balancing is used. The default key "LBTag"
# can be overwritten by setting the "affinityBalancerTag" property.

# If "enableSystemDatabase" is enabled, then use this template to enforce
# the NuoDB "nuodb_system" admin database.

# Once admin db is created during bootstrap, use Auto Console UI to edit
# the admin db's template.

# By default, an agent will shutdown when the peer attempt failed. By setting
# this property, the agent will continue to try to entry peer, until the timeout
# in milliseconds has been reached. To preserve backward compatibility, the default
# is to not retry. Note that this option is not related to agent reconnect when
# its peer broker disconnects; this option is only for the initial entry into the
# domain.

# This property enables auto-restart of single host databases. The broker
# writes a marker file into the varDir (e.g. /var/opt/nuodb1/demo-archives/)
# when a database starts up. On machine / broker restart, the broker starts
# any database for which a marker exists. A database shutdown command will
# remove the marker. Only applicable for "un-managed" databases not governed
# by Automation.
# Code default is false, to preserve backward compatibilty
# singleHostDbRestart = false

# Set this property to inject additional Host Tags into the agent's TagService.
# Well-defined host tags that are injected by default such as "osversion", "region"
# can not be overwritten and will be ignored. The format is a comma-separated list
# of key=value pairs, with each string token being trimmed.
# Example: hostTags = tag1 = val, tag2=v2

# ADDED in 2.1 #

# Set this property to false if a broker JVM termination (kill -TERM, including
# service restart) should not remove itself from the durable domain
# configuration.
#removeSelfOnShutdown = true

# If this property is set to true, the broker(s) will provision the optional
# database "nuodb_system" in the domain. Among other things, it stores
# persistent metrics on hosts and database processes which are available both in
# the Automation Console UI as well as the Rest API. This database is managed,
# and will be automated using the template per the above "automationTemplate"
# property. If it's not provisioned automatically here during broker startup,
# it can always be created later using managed database creation.

# There are three timeout value properties that can be adjusted if Raft
# leadership is not stable. As a general set of rules:
# 1. RaftHeartbeatTimeout should be significantly higher than the latency
# 2. RaftMinElectionTimeout should be significantly higher than the
#    RaftHeartbeatTimeout
# 3. RaftMaxElectionTimeout should be higher than RaftMinElectionTimeout
# If elections are being triggered too often the RaftHeartbeatTimeout and/or
#  the RaftMinElectionTimeout should be increased (maintaining the above rules).
# If elections take too many rounds to be resolved (lots of "Converting to
#  Candidate" with no "Converting to Leader") the difference between
#  RaftMinElectionTimeout and RaftMaxElectionTimeout should be increased
#  (likely by increasing RaftMaxElectionTimeout).
# timeouts are in ms

# Agent/Broker ping their connected peer(s) periodically. A warning is printed
# if we don't hear a ping-ack after 10 seconds, and then continuously after that
# until the timeout.
# If the peer ping ack has not been received after 'heartbeatPeerTimeout'
# seconds, then the Agent/Broker will not close the session with the connected
# Agent/Broker.
# Use value > 0 for timeout to go into effect; 0 means wait forever, don't timeout.
# Choose a value higher than "RaftMaxElectionTimeout". The default is 10min; note
# that the 2.0.x default was 0.
#heartbeatPeerTimeout = 600

# Enforcer schedule properties: the Enforcer runs periodically in the Broker
# that is the current Leader, by default every 10 seconds, with an initial delay
# of 15 seconds after the Broker starts up. Each Enforcer run performs at most
# one process start per database.
# By default, most domain events (Agent joins/leaves, database engine process
# joins/leaves, update to a database template etc) call the Enforcer directly
# regardless of the schedule. This is useful in development/demo mode but should
# be disabled in production.

# Every update to the Broker's durable domain state causes a "log entry". This
# property allows you to set a max number of entries to be stored in the
# log. When the Broker starts, it reads all log entries to compute the current
# set of state-machines. This can get expensive if you have a large number of
# entries, which are also held in memory. The default behavior is to leave the
# threshold high to provide backward compatibility; otherwise rolling upgrade
# might break if a new Broker sends information to an older Broker. It is
# recommended that a customer should set this property to a lower number.
